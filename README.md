# MPACO :ant::ant::ant:
This is a task migration simulator based on Ant Colony Optimization. Core idea is to reduce power and temperature of the overall MPSoC through the metaheuristic - Ant Colony Algorithm. Simulator is broken down into controllers and models to be easily modified and used in any project.
